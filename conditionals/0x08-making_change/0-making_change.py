Given a pile of coins of different values,
determine the fewest number of coins needed
to meet a given amount total.

    - Prototype: def makeChange(coins, total)
    - Return: fewest number of coins needed to meet total
        If total is 0 or less, return 0
        If total cannot be met by any number of coins you have,
        return -1
    - coins is a list of the values of the coins in your possession
    - The value of a coin will always be an integer greater than 0
    - You can assume you have an infinite number of each
      denomination of coin in the list
    - Your solutionâ€™s runtime will be evaluated in this task
